Firstly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All commands must be ran from the docker directory, that's the one containing 
this README and the *.yml files



Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To setup as an implementer (everything is automagically installed):
./setup_as_imp.sh

To setup as a dev (you just build & all the bits go to the tomcat container):
./setup_as_dev.sh




Starting MOTECH the first time
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type the following:

  fig up -d

which will start MOTECH in the background
wait a little bit then direct your browser to:
http://localhost:8080/motech-platform-server

****************************
*** SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE ***
****************************
'fig up' ERASES ALL YOUR DATA
you have to run it at least once to setup MOTECH
if you run it again, it'll erase everything you did in MOTECH
it's useful to start afresh, but remember: it nukes everything




Stop MOTECH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type the following:

  fig stop




Restart MOTECH
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type the following:

  fig start




Watching logs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
to watch all the logs (very verbose):

  fig logs

to watch only the tomcat logs:

  fig logs tomcat

see the sections in the generated fig.yml to see what other logs you can watch





Lastly
